# CCPTL
CodeISM Competitve Programming Template Library

## Aim
The aim of this repository is to provide copy-pastable code snippets. Focus is more on efficiency/performance as opposed to readability.

## Usage
Code snippets in a file is meant to be self sufficient so no addtional requirements.

Note: A modern C++ compiler with support of `c++14` or later is required although most the files might work with lower versions too. 

Desired version of C++ standard can be enabled by passing `-std=c++14` to most of the compilers.
